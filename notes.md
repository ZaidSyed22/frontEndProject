**API ideas are our initial reviews**
- NYT critic movie reviews
    - API: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview
    - Description: Long-form critic reviews.
    - Thoughts: Not great. The actual content hides behind a paywall.
    - Use case: Share a teaser setence, author name, and say "click here to visit in-depth NYT critic review"
- TMDB
    - API: https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/discover
    - Description: Massive user-generated movie and TV show database.
    - Thoughts: So much potential. No limits.
    - Use case: Recommended movies ("if you like XYZ, also check out..."), trending movies, best movies by genre/year/rating
- Movie quotes
    - API: https://english.api.rakuten.net/juanroldan1989/api/moviequotes
    - Description: Generate quotes by actor, movie, etc.
    - Thoughts: Lacks good documentation, too complicated.
    - Use case: Pull a quote from the movie in question, or create a separate tab for generating movie quotes
- Movie soundtracks (*tbd not yet explored*)
    - API: https://developer.soundtrackyourbrand.com/api/#docs-that-don-39-t-suck

**Website ideas**
- Type in a movie / TV series and recieve reviews from multiple sources (i.e., rotten tomatoes, IMDB, metacritic)
- Based on the movie the user types in, generate a list of recommendations (cool idea because we're getting APIs to interact, also will be a fun challenge)
- Generate the most popular movies / trending movies, can be filtered by genre/year, etc. (completely disconnected / separate API calls - perhaps a separate tab in the navbar)
- Pull movie soundtracks (unsure / yet to explore API )
- Pull random movie quotes (unsure if we can get the API working)

**Github practices**
- When pushing, set other two people as approvers
- Both should comment that they "agree" for something to get pushed
- DD is still in God mode (not sure how to fix - to ask Dre)
